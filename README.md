### What I learned
- I got better understanding of how state and ref works in react.

- I also learnt how to pull out data from a local api and use in react library.

- I learnt more about destructuring. Destructuring is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct variables.

 - I learnt the steps to deploying a React App to GitHub Pages. They are as follows:
    - Install the gh-pages npm package and designate it as a development dependency: npm install gh-pages --save-dev
    - Add a homepage property to the package.json file:
     "homepage": "https://gitname.github.io/react-gh-pages"
     - Add deployment scripts to the package.json file: 
      "predeploy": "npm run build",
        "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
    - Add a "remote" that points to the GitHub repository
    git remote add origin https://github.com/{username}/{repo-name}.git
    -  Deploy the React app to GitHub Pages: 
     npm run deploy
