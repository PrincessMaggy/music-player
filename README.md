## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Sass
- React


### What I learned
- I got better understanding of how state and ref works in react.
- I also learnt how to pull out data from a local api and use in react library.
- I learnt more about destructuring. Destructuring is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct variables.
